Since the current version 5.04 was released today, and is called hoary hedgehog
we might as well make a joke about it.
It will first disable the terminal, then will pop up a picture of sanic saying 
"gotta go fast" 
this will follow your clock opening up and being set to January 13th 2000,
then it will start going up 1 year per second until it reaches January 13th 2038
which is the day that UNIX gets bricked on 32 bit systems by Y2K38
however, if your system is detected as 64 bit, on January 13th 2020, it will
wipe your master boot record, then continue to count until it bricks itself
so even if your system is 64 bit, you will still receive alotta damage :)
