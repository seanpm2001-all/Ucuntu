Displays message box saying: THE POWER OF 32 BIT ISN'T HIGH ENOUGH! LET'S GO UP!
When the message box is clicked:
everything starts scrolling up automatically, Windows will start flying to the top
of the screen.
This will also trigger an integer count that goes from the 16 bit value of 65,536
all the way to the 32 bit value of 2147483647, and will start counting by 32,767
if the system is not 32 bit, it will then start counting by 1,000,000s until it reaches
a 64 bit integer. It will then continue to run until it either crashes, or reaches a googol
(1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000)
