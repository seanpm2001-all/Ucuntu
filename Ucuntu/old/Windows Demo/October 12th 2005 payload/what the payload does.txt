October 12th 2005 is the release date of Ubuntu 5.10 breezy badger, so your 
computer is going to get a bit windy
it will start again by locking your administrative access, then it will start
making all text documents fly to the side of your screen, and the breeze will 
continue for a while, before it causes a kernel panic
not much, but it is something
when your computer reboots, all the text documents will be replaced with the text:

BREEEZYBREEZYBREEZYBREEZYBREEZYBREEZYBREEZYBREEZYBREEZYBREEZY

for 510 lines, causing a total of 31,620 bytes of text to be in the document.
