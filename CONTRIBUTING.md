### Rules

> * No trackers - Despite being a trojan for Ubuntu, I don't want any trackers in the program. 

> * No anti-VM code - This project is designed to be run in Ubuntu virtual machines. Running it on a host Ubuntu computer can be dangerous. Anti-VM code will break the safety and add liability to damage. Anti-VM code will make this project illegal

> * Do not modify archive files - Archive files serve as an archive of a days work, and should not be modified after they are created

> * Do not modify the Wiki or the ProjectWiki directory - I want to be in control of this projects Wiki. The ProjectWiki directory is also an archive directory with archive files, so modifying it would be a violation of both rule 3 and rule 4.

> * Do not modify Contributing, license, or README files - These files are sensitive, and only myself and the contributers I add can modify these files

> * Create archive files after each commit - After each commit to the normal file, you must copy and paste your changes into a separate file with a V at the end, following with the version number (as in how many archive files for this file, not as in 1.0.1)

> * Keep it clean - The name has a bad word in it, but do not use any swears, sexual innuendos, slurs, or hate speech in any part of the program, the only instance of dirty talk that can be done is mentioning the name. Also try to mention the name as rarely as possible

> * Keep it light - Avoid unneccessary bloat, as this program is intended to work on every version of Ubuntu

> * Use the provided languages - Please only write in Shell. No other languages can be used anymore.

### Help wanted

~Currently, no major help is wanted~

I need help with this project. I am very bad at Bash, as I don't use it that often, and most of my programs here are a script kiddie mess. As long as you follow the contribution rules and know enough about BASH, you can help.
